      <p>The following is a response to <i>Bauer, Brandan. To Open [...] To Collect [...] To Expand [...] To Continue: Richard Serra's Verb List, Post Internet Appropriation, and the Culture of the Use of Forms</i>.</p>
      <p>Listed below are four additional definitions from the end of the reading.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>To Index:</dt>
        <dd>Indexing now operates on a website in a way similar to the index of a book. To index a webpage is to reveal a site map or similar set of links to all pages on the site that are accessible to a user. Indexing takes on a new form in terms of databases, where indexing of data is used to speed query/search functionality by leveraging data structures designed for this purpose.</dd>
        <dt>To Cycle:</dt>
        <dd>Moving through content in a continuous, sometimes circular fashion. For example, a person may cycle through their social media feed on a daily basis. We may also use cycle to refer to the 'carousel' image elements common on websites, which show a continuous slideshow of content.</dd>
        <dt>To Link:</dt>
        <dd>Linking is now an entirely non-physical term which refers to the use of anchor tags to reference other content. Visiting or clicking on a link  leads to the display of this content. Links are often used to expand an idea, to share related content, and to cite a reference for an element. For instance, one may use a link under an image element to credit an artist on a photography website.</dd>
        <dt>To Share:</dt>
        <dd>Sharing content is one of the primary ways people now communicate in a web-central environment. Sharing involves the inclusion of content in a post to a public or private audience. This can include sending links or imagery over a public forum, such as a social media website, as well as using messaging and email systems. Sharing usually no longer refers to doing anything with another person, instead it is used almost exclusively to mean showing a person or persons content.</dd>
